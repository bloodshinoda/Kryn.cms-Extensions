Development

To install, use and develop on one of these extensions, you need to do some steps to work
without coping the files around from your working Kryn.cms installation to the
cloned git repository. 

Please note:
You only need to do this steps, when you want to develop on these extensions.
When you just wanna install a extension and use it, go to kryn.org/extensions
or install a extension directly through the administration of your installation.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install newest Kryn.cms, if you dont have already one.
3. Use the install.sh to create all symbolic links to your installed Kryn.cms.

 install.sh install <extensionCode> <targetKrynCms>

Example:

 ./install.sh install newsletter /srv/www/kryn.cms/
 ./install.sh remove newsletter /srv/www/kryn.cms/

Use `install.sh help` to get more informations.

4. Open the administration of Kryn.cms and press Activate in the extension window.
