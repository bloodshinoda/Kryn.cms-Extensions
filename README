Development

To install, use and develop a extension, you need to do some steps to work
without coping the files around from your working Kryn.cms installation to the
cloned git repository.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install newest Kryn.cms, if you dont have already one.
3. Use the install.sh to create all symbolic links to your installed Kryn.cms.

 install.sh install <extensionCode> <targetKrynCms> 

4. Open the administration of Kryn.cms and press Activate in the extension window.
